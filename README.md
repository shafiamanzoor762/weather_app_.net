## 💻 Installation

### Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or higher
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework)
* Visual Studio 2019 or later (for development)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

cd weathering
WeatherApp.sln
```

3. Install dependencies (if any NuGet packages are used).

4. Build and run the app (F5 or click ▶️ Run).

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User inputs a city name.
2. App sends a request to a public Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
3. JSON response is parsed and displayed in the UI.
4. Forecast data is stored for quick display and refreshes periodically.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Language**: C#
* **Framework**: .NET Windows Forms
* **UI**: WinForms Controls
* **API**: [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) (or other official weather API)
* **IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 (recommended)

## 🔌 API Integration

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API (or your chosen provider). You need an API key.

### Steps to Obtain API Key:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up and generate a free API key
3. Update your code to include the API key:

```csharp
string apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
string url = $"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={apiKey}&units=metric";
```

> ⚠️ Do not hard-code the API key in public repositories. Use a config file or environment variable for production.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Launch the app.
2. Enter a city name (e.g., **London**, **New York**).
3. Click **"Get Weather"**.
4. View real-time temperature, condition, forecast, and more.
